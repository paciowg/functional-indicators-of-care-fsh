* effective[x] ^comment = "The use of effective[x] and dateTime versus Period is subject to implementer workflow and needs.  In most situations, an observation is considered as a point in time, even if the assessment occurred over a period of time.  Period is included in this implementation guide to provide additional flexibility for specific use cases.  However, it is expected most observations will be recorded using DateTime.  Furthermore, any retrieval of information should return the relevant if DateTime is requested, even if the original observation was recorded as a period.  Some implementers may choose to use additional functions in there retrieves to 'normalize' intervals, as is done in Clinical Quality Language (CQL)."
